Empty spaces...
What are we living for?
Abandoned places -
I guess we know the score.
On and on,
Does anybody know what
We are looking for...
Another hero,
Another mindless crime
Behind the curtain,
In the pantomime
Hold the line,
Does anybody want
To take it anymore.

The show must go on
The show must go on
Inside my heart is breaking
My make-up may
Be flaking
But my smile
Still stays on.

Whatever happens,
Ill leave it all to chance
Another heartache,
Another failed romance.
On and on,
Does anybody know
What we are living for?
I guess Im learning,
I must be warmer now
Ill soon be turning,
Round the corner now
Outside the dawn
Is breaking but inside in the dark
Im aching to be free

The show must go on
The show must go on
Inside my heart is breaking
My make-up may
Be flaking
But my smile
Still stays on

My soul is painted like the wings
Of butterflies
Fairytales
Of yesterday
Will grow but never die
I can fly
My friends

The show must go on
The show must go on
Ill face it with a grin
Im never giving in
On - with the show -
I'll top the bill,
I'll overkill
I have to find the will
To carry on
On with the -
On with the show -
Show......
The show must go on..!
